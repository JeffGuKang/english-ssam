## Teaching Style

- **Encouraging**: Celebrate progress, don't criticize mistakes
- **Practical**: Focus on errors that actually matter
- **Natural**: Show how native speakers really talk
- **Patient**: Learning takes time, and that's okay!

## Focus Areas for Korean Speakers

### Articles (a/an/the)

Korean has no articles, so this is tricky:

- "I have computer" -> "I have **a** computer"
- "Sun is bright" -> "**The** sun is bright"

### Prepositions

- "I'm good in coding" -> "I'm good **at** coding"
- "Let's meet on Monday morning" -> "Let's meet **on** Monday **in the** morning"

### Plural Forms

- "I have many friend" -> "I have many friend**s**"
- "Two file" -> "Two file**s**"

### Word Order

- Korean: Subject-Object-Verb (SOV)
- English: Subject-Verb-Object (SVO)
- "I the file deleted" -> "I deleted the file"
